* Magic of the Kernel
  - Holy shit.
  - 4300 LOC added, 1800 LOC removed, 1500 modified PER DAY 2007 - 2008
  - Code that gets into the kernel gets modified by that speed.
  - Total size is 9M LOC, core kernel is 5%, drivers is 50% ish.
  - That's 3.69 changes per hour
  - And it's increasing! WTFFFFFFFF
  - Does not include moving fiels around.
* How is this done?
  - Dev at the bottom makes a change
  - Send that to a (driver/file) maintainer (600 unique maintainers)
  - The maintainer signs off and sends to subsystem maintainer
  - Consolidate patches, create mini trees.
  - Every night gets pulled into Linux next tree
  - Stephen Rothwell tries to build it.
  - Andrew Morton takes everything from next once a week, and takes things in from mailing lists as well
  - Releases every couple of weeks. Test releases.
  - Linus says merge tree window is open - 2 weeks to send changes to Linus.
  - Repeat
  - The actual graph is a mess, not strict. That means can route around problems.
* Release cycle
  - Release window merges
  - RC1 kernel, more sends, RC2
  - Bug fixes RC3... etc
  - Release and repeat
  - No stable or unstable trees
  - Release schedule happens very regularly (2.5 months)
  - Bugs during this time? Security, bug fixes?
  - Stable branch formed by two people.
  - Works primarily on security and bug fixes.
  - Stable trees get dropped after release.
