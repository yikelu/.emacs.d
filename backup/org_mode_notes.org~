** Origins
   - Note taking mode for emacs. Dual note and task oriented.
   - old thing for emacs - outline mode. too broken
   - enhance the sub heading stuff and indentation
   - fix and simplify the shortcuts.

** New Shortcuts
   - Two main commands - tab (cycle subtree) and shift tab (cycle globally)
   - Cycle of 3 in each. First tab is direct children, second is entire subtree, third is refold
   - Global - first is TOC, second is full expansion, third is collapse

** Structure editing
   - M or M-S while using cursors
   - up/down are transposes, left and right are promote/demote

** Other nice features
   - Edits ordered and unordered lists
   - Hyperlinks works (gnus, emacs mail programs, man pages etc)
   - Table editor/spreadsheet
   - Embedded LaTeX

** Meta data on top of outline
*** Example headline:
    TODO [#B] Get new laptop :buy:Frys:work
    DEADLINE: <2008-07-03 THU>
    :PROPERTIES:
    .
    .
    .
    :END:
    
    - TODO first keyword. Has multiple states - TODO, DONE, WAITING, CANCELLED
    - Priority cookie of [#B]
    - Name (get new laptop
    - Tags at the end (:buy:Frys:work)
    - Then deadline data and properties
*** Meta Data Hierarchy
    - Downward propagation (inheritance)
      - children inherit tags and properties
    - Upward propagation (accumulation)
      - certain things can be summed
      
*** Interfaces for Meta Data
    - One key per tag interface
    - completion wherever useful
    - date/time reading function (has calendar in there)
    - column view for tabluar editing (outline struct into table)
    
*** Capture with remember.el
    - "ultimate capture tool for emacs", quick way to jot stuff down
    - can set up templates for it in org mode
    - Templates define content/meta
      - Todo headline
      - link to context
      - target location for note
   

** Collect and display
 - Tasks can be in special lists
 - or scattered
 - How to find it? Simple queries on text or meta data
 - sparse strees (outline structure)
 - Agenda views (outline nodes => flat list)
   - Agenda view is very much like a standard scheduler/planner layout
   - Can also search and modify in agenda view


** Export and publish
   - HTML w/ javascript
   - LaTeX
   - ASCII - make it even more readable for email
   - Sets can be linked to a publishing project (?)

** Table tricks
   - Start with separator fields, and tab will splay them out. Use tab/s-tab to navigate

     #+TBLFM: $3=taylor($1)
   - Can use emacs calc formulas, holy shittttt

** Radio Tables
   - Allowed to embed Org mode table in comment of any mode
   - Define translation to convert table into right format (usually a one liner)
   - Define location to insert transformed table.

** Context-sensitive keys
   - Meta + cursor is ...
     - structure editing headlines
     - table struc editing in tables
   - C-c C-c look and update (many variations)
   - Tab cycles visibility, moves around in tables and latex template expansion
   - In tables, normal characters are automatic overwrite
