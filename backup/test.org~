** Origins
   -- Note taking mode for emacs. Dual note and task oriented.
   -- old thing for emacs - outline mode. too broken
   -- enhance the sub heading stuff and indentation
   -- fix and simplify the shortcuts.
** New Shortcuts
   -- Two main commands - tab (cycle subtree) and shift tab (cycle globally)
   -- Cycle of 3 in each. First tab is direct children, second is entire subtree, third is refold
   -- Global - first is TOC, second is full expansion, third is collapse
** Structure editing
   -- M or M-S while using cursors
   -- up/down are transposes, left and right are promote/demote
** Other nice features
   -- Edits ordered and unordered lists
   -- Hyperlinks works (gnus, emacs mail programs, man pages etc)
   -- Table editor/spreadsheet
   -- Embedded LaTeX
